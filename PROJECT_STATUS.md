## 💡 Key Insights from Development

### What Worked Well
1. **Data Consolidation:** PowerShell scripts effectively organized scattered files
2. **Component Design:** Self-contained HamletCandidateBrowser is reusable
3. **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks for missing data
4. **Documentation:** Multiple levels (quick start, detailed, technical)

### Lessons Learned
1. **Directory matters:** Many user errors from running commands in wrong location
2. **Dependencies:** terser not included by default in Vite 6
3. **CSV parsing:** Need robust parser for quoted fields with commas
4. **User level:** Non-technical user needs very explicit instructions

### Recommendations
1. **Always verify directory** before running commands
2. **Use automated scripts** to reduce human error
3. **Test with real data** early and often
4. **Document everything** at user's technical level

## 🔐 Security & Privacy

### Current Status
- ✅ All candidate data is from public electoral records
- ✅ No private information collected without consent
- ✅ Client-side only (no backend database yet)

### Before Production Launch
- [ ] Add privacy policy page
- [ ] Add terms of service
- [ ] Implement HTTPS (automatic with Vercel)
- [ ] Add cookie consent if needed
- [ ] Review data handling compliance

## 📝 Developer Notes

### For Future Developers

This project started as a consolidation effort from multiple scattered versions. The key challenge was organizing the work without losing any valuable features.

**Critical Files:**
- `components/HamletCandidateBrowser.tsx` - Main candidate interface
- `public/candidates.csv` - Must be present for app to work
- `FIX_EVERYTHING.ps1` - Fixes most common issues

**Common Pitfalls:**
1. Running commands from wrong directory (always verify with `pwd`)
2. Forgetting to copy candidate data to `public/`
3. Missing terser for production builds

**Best Practices:**
1. Always test with full 7,769 candidate dataset
2. Handle missing/malformed data gracefully
3. Provide clear user feedback for all operations
4. Keep documentation updated
