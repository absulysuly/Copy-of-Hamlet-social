# ðŸš€ Hamlet Platform - Quick Start Guide

## For Non-Technical Users

### Step 1: Open PowerShell in the Right Place

1. Open File Explorer
2. Navigate to: `E:\HamletUnified\Copy-of-Hamlet-social`
3. In the address bar, type `powershell` and press Enter
4. A blue PowerShell window will open

### Step 2: Run the Automatic Fix Script

Copy and paste this command:

```powershell
.\FIX_EVERYTHING.ps1
```

Press Enter.

### Step 3: Wait for Setup to Complete

The script will:
- âœ… Install all required software packages
- âœ… Copy your candidate data
- âœ… Fix any errors
- âœ… Test that everything works

This takes about 2-5 minutes.

### Step 4: Start the Platform

When prompted "Would you like to start the dev server now? (Y/N)", type `Y` and press Enter.

### Step 5: Open in Browser

Open your web browser and go to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

You should see your Hamlet Election Platform! ðŸŽ‰

## If Something Goes Wrong

### Error: "Cannot be loaded because running scripts is disabled"

Run this command first:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```
Then try `.\FIX_EVERYTHING.ps1` again.

### Error: "vite is not recognized"

You're in the wrong folder! Make sure you're in:
```
E:\HamletUnified\Copy-of-Hamlet-social
```

### Can't See Candidates

Make sure this file exists:
```
E:\HamletUnified\Copy-of-Hamlet-social\public\candidates.csv
```

If not, copy it manually:
```powershell
Copy-Item -Path "E:\HamletUnified\full_consolidation\candidates\master\CLEANED_CANDIDATES_20251015_120734.csv" -Destination "public\candidates.csv" -Force
```

### Port 3000 Already in Use

Kill the process and try again:
```powershell
npx kill-port 3000
npm run dev
```

## What You Have Now

- âœ… Working development environment
- âœ… 7,769 Iraqi election candidates loaded
- âœ… Search and filter functionality
- âœ… Ready to deploy to the internet

## Next: Deploy to the Internet (Free)

### Using Vercel (Easiest)

1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Sign up with GitHub
3. Click "New Project"
4. Select your repository: `Copy-of-Hamlet-social`

Share this URL with candidates to show them the platform!
