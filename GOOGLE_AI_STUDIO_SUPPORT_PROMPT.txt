Subject: Model Availability & API Integration Clarification

Hello Google AI Studio Support Team,

I'm developing a multilingual social media platform for Iraqi political campaigns using the @google/genai SDK (v1.25.0) in a React/TypeScript application.

TECHNICAL DETAILS:
------------------
- SDK Package: @google/genai v1.25.0
- Framework: React 19.2.0 + Vite 7.1.10 + TypeScript 5.8.2
- Environment: Browser-based application
- API Key Source: https://aistudio.google.com/apikey

CURRENT IMPLEMENTATION:
-----------------------
```typescript
import { GoogleGenAI } from "@google/genai";

const ai = new GoogleGenAI({ 
    apiKey: import.meta.env.VITE_GEMINI_API_KEY 
});

const response = await ai.models.generateContent({
    model: 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp',
    contents: 'Generate content...'
});

console.log(response.text);
```

USE CASES:
----------
1. Content Generation: Creating social media posts in Arabic
2. Text Translation: Arabic ↔ English ↔ Kurdish (Sorani)
3. Real-time translation for political campaign content

QUESTIONS:
----------

1. MODEL AVAILABILITY
   - Is 'gemini-2.0-flash-exp' the correct and current model name?
   - Previously we used 'gemini-2.5-flash' - has this been deprecated?
   - What are the recommended models for production use?
   - Are there regional restrictions for Iraq/Middle East access?

2. API COMPATIBILITY
   - Is the @google/genai v1.25.0 SDK stable for production?
   - Any known issues with browser-based implementations?
   - Rate limits for free tier API keys?
   - Best practices for error handling?

3. FEATURES NEEDED
   - Support for RTL (Right-to-Left) Arabic text
   - Translation accuracy for political/formal Arabic
   - Kurdish (Sorani) language support quality
   - Character limits for generated content

4. PRODUCTION READINESS
   - Security recommendations for client-side vs server-side implementation
   - Quota recommendations for ~1000 daily users
   - Billing estimates for translation + content generation
   - Uptime SLA and reliability guarantees

CURRENT STATUS:
---------------
✓ SDK installed and imported successfully
✓ Application builds without errors
✓ Dev server runs without issues
? Need confirmation on correct model names
? Need API key configuration guidance
? Need production deployment best practices

SPECIFIC TECHNICAL CONCERN:
----------------------------
After updating from older Gemini integration, the application loads but we want to ensure:
1. We're using the latest stable model names
2. Our API configuration follows current best practices
3. We're prepared for production deployment
4. We have proper error handling for API failures

ERROR MESSAGES (if any):
------------------------
[Paste any error messages from browser console here]

REQUEST:
--------
Please provide:
- Current list of valid model names for production
- Recommended setup for browser-based React applications
- Migration guide if model names have changed recently
- Best practices documentation link

Thank you for your assistance!
