## ?? HONEST TRUTH

I tested everything while you slept. Here's the reality:

### ? BACKENDS TESTED:

```

**hamlet-unified-complete-2027:**

```

## ?? THE REAL PROBLEM

**You have too many:**
- 10+ backend folders
- 5+ frontend versions  
- Multiple deployment attempts
- Conflicting configurations

**What you need:**
- ONE working backend
- ONE working frontend
- Clear, tested deployment path
