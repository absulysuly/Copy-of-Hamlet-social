**Subject: Production-Grade Architecture Review for High-Traffic Iraqi Election Platform**

I'm developing a critical political campaign platform for the Iraqi elections (launching in 25 days). The platform needs to handle:

- **Target Users**: 6,988+ candidates + millions of voters
- **Requirements**: 
  - Must work on ALL mobile devices (including old Android 8+ and iOS 12+)
  - Must support Arabic/RTL layout perfectly
  - Must load in < 3 seconds on 3G connections
  - Must handle 100,000+ concurrent users during peak times
  - Zero downtime tolerance (election deadline is critical)

**Current Tech Stack**:
- Frontend: React 19.2 + TypeScript + Vite
- APIs: Google Gemini AI for content generation and translation
- Hosting: Vercel/Netlify
- Database: Mock data (will connect to real backend)

**Critical Pain Point**:
I've had recurring deployment issues where:
- Build succeeds ✓
- Deployment reports success ✓  
- But site doesn't load on many devices ❌

**What I Need From You**:

1. **Architecture Review**: 
   - Is React 19.2 too new for broad device compatibility?
   - Should I use React 18 instead for better stability?
   - What's the optimal bundle size for 3G users?

2. **Mobile Optimization**:
   - Best practices for serving Arabic/RTL content on older devices
   - How to optimize Gemini API calls for slow connections
   - Progressive Web App (PWA) recommendations for offline support

3. **Error Recovery**:
   - Bulletproof error boundaries and fallback strategies
   - How to handle API failures gracefully
   - Service worker strategies for reliability

4. **Performance**:
   - Code splitting strategies for React 19
   - Lazy loading best practices
   - Caching strategies for Gemini API responses

5. **Deployment**:
   - Most reliable hosting platform for MENA region
   - CDN configuration for Iraq/Middle East
   - Environment variable best practices

**Success Criteria**:
- 99.9% uptime during 25-day campaign period
- < 3 second load time on 3G
- Works on 95%+ of devices in Iraq
- Handles traffic spikes (10x normal load)

**Please provide**:
1. Specific code changes/architecture recommendations
2. Technology alternatives if current stack is risky
3. Testing strategy for 25+ device types
4. Deployment checklist with zero-failure guarantee

## Alternative Shorter Prompt:

**Quick Technical Audit Request:**

Review my React 19.2 + Vite + Gemini AI platform for Iraqi elections. Must work on ALL mobile devices (old Android/iOS) with Arabic/RTL support. Currently: builds succeed but doesn't load on many devices. Need: architecture fixes, mobile optimization, error recovery, and bulletproof deployment strategy. Deadline: 25 days. Zero failure tolerance.

Provide specific code recommendations and tech alternatives.
