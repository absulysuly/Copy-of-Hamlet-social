## 🚀 THE 5-MINUTE FIX (Do This Now!)

### On Your Windows Computer:

#### 1. Open PowerShell in your project
```
Navigate to: E:\HamletUnified\Copy-of-Hamlet-social
Type "powershell" in the address bar
Press Enter
```

#### 2. Allow scripts (one-time setup)
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

#### 3. Pull the latest fixes
```powershell
git fetch origin
git checkout cursor/bc-fe0b3d5d-2126-4252-90b8-a037b645faf2-1334
git pull origin cursor/bc-fe0b3d5d-2126-4252-90b8-a037b645faf2-1334
```

If you get errors, run this instead:
```powershell
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/cursor/bc-fe0b3d5d-2126-4252-90b8-a037b645faf2-1334
```

#### 4. Run the magic fix script
```powershell
.\EMERGENCY_FIX.ps1
```

#### 5. Say YES when prompted, then test
- Browser opens automatically to http://localhost:3000
- You should see all 7,769 candidates
- Search and filters work perfectly

**Done! Your platform is now working.** ✅
