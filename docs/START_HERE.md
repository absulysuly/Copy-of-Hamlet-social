## 🚨 RED FLAGS - STOP SIGNALS

**If ANY of these occur in first 7 days, PAUSE and reassess:**

1. Zero new users for 3 consecutive days
2. Platform crashes >5 times/day
3. Multiple accusations of political bias (3+)
4. Legal threat or government inquiry
5. Physical safety concerns
6. Complete financial depletion (<1 month runway)

**Action if red flag:** 
→ Stop all outreach  
→ Consult legal/technical advisor  
→ Reassess viability  
→ Consider pivot or shutdown  

**Do NOT push through red flags hoping they'll resolve. They won't.**

---

## ✅ GREEN LIGHTS - ACCELERATE SIGNALS

**If these occur in first 7 days, you're on track:**

1. 5+ organic users (not directly invited by you)
2. 10+ unprompted posts/comments
3. 1+ media inquiry
4. 1+ candidate asks to join (you didn't chase)
5. 1+ post goes "viral" (100+ views in platform)
6. Positive feedback from 80%+ users

**Action if green lights:**
→ Double down on what's working  
→ Increase outreach intensity  
→ Start planning Week 2 scaling  
→ Document success stories

## 💡 THE PHILOSOPHY: WHY THIS WILL WORK

**Most Iraqi civic platforms fail because they:**
1. Over-engineer (complex features no one uses)
2. Over-promise (grants that never come)
3. Under-deliver on emotion (boring, technical)
4. Ignore culture (Western models don't fit)

**Hamlet will succeed because you:**
1. ✅ Start small (Baghdad + Erbil only)
2. ✅ Focus on emotion (pride, belonging, legacy)
3. ✅ Respect culture (Digital Wasta, Tribal Cascade)
4. ✅ Monetize early (ethical, sustainable)
5. ✅ Build human-first (in-person events, personal outreach)
6. ✅ Iterate fast (daily improvements based on feedback)

---

## 🎯 THE VISION: WHERE THIS GOES

### Month 1 (Now)
Baghdad + Erbil pilot → 1,000 users → $5-8k revenue → Proof of concept

### Month 2-3
Add 3 more cities → 5,000 users → $20k/month revenue → First grant arrives

### Month 4-6
All 18 governorates → 50,000 users → $50k/month revenue → Media coverage

### Year 1
500,000 users → $150k-300k total revenue → Iraq's primary civic platform

### Year 2+
Regional expansion (Lebanon, Jordan?) → Democracy infrastructure for MENA → Exit or scale

**But first: Just get to 1,000 users in 30 days.**

---

## 🔥 FINAL WORDS: THE MINDSET

### Remember:

**You are not building a product. You are building a movement.**

Hamlet is not software.  
Hamlet is Iraq's digital living room.  
Hamlet is where democracy feels like conversation.  
Hamlet is where voices become power.

### Your Daily Mantra:

*"صوتك... قوتك... مستقبلك"*  
*(Your voice... your power... your future)*

**This is not about technology.**  
**This is about giving Iraq its voice back.**
