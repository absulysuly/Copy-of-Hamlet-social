HEY CLAUDE! Here's the situation:

I have an Iraqi Election Platform with:

1. FRONTEND: Already deployed on Vercel
   URL: https://test-new-frontend.vercel.app
   Repo: https://github.com/absulysuly/DigitalDemocracy.Iraq

2. DATABASE: Empty Postgres on Railway
   URL: postgresql://postgres:ULbaXjTrdDBavxJnNScVSQkLmhqOonMc@crossover.proxy.rlwy.net:42786/railway

3. BACKEND: Ready but NOT deployed yet
   Location: /workspace/iraq-election-masterpiece/
   Contains: Complete API with 7,769 Iraqi candidates ready to seed

WHAT I NEED:

1. Deploy the backend to Railway
2. Seed the database with Iraqi election data
3. Connect frontend to backend

THE FILES:

- frontend-api.ts = Frontend API service (put in lib/api.ts)
- Backend code = Complete in /workspace/iraq-election-masterpiece/
- Instructions = Full deployment guide

BACKEND NEEDS TO:
- Connect to existing Postgres database (URL above)
- Deploy to Railway
- Run migrations
- Seed 7,769 Iraqi candidates
- Give me the Railway URL

THEN:
- I'll set NEXT_PUBLIC_API_BASE_URL in Vercel to the Railway URL
- Redeploy frontend
- DONE!

CAN YOU HELP ME DEPLOY THE BACKEND TO RAILWAY?

The backend is production-ready with:
? 14 API endpoints
? 7,769 candidates (seed script ready)
? 18 Iraqi governorates
? 16 political parties
? Complete security (Helmet, rate limiting)
? All documentation

Just needs to be deployed!
