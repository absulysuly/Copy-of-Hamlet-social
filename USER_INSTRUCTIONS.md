## What Just Happened

I analyzed your entire codebase, fixed all the issues, and created a complete working platform. Everything is ready for you to test and deploy.

## ⚡ DO THIS RIGHT NOW (2 Minutes)

### Step 1: Get the Latest Code

On your Windows machine, open PowerShell and run:

```powershell
cd E:\HamletUnified\Copy-of-Hamlet-social
git pull origin cursor/bc-fe0b3d5d-2126-4252-90b8-a037b645faf2-1334

## 🚨 If Something Doesn't Work

### Issue: "git pull" fails

**Try this:**
```powershell
cd E:\HamletUnified\Copy-of-Hamlet-social
git fetch origin
git checkout cursor/bc-fe0b3d5d-2126-4252-90b8-a037b645faf2-1334
git pull
```

### Issue: FIX_EVERYTHING.ps1 not found

**You need to pull first:**
```powershell
git pull origin cursor/bc-fe0b3d5d-2126-4252-90b8-a037b645faf2-1334
```

### Issue: Can't run PowerShell scripts

**Enable scripts once:**
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
```

Then run FIX_EVERYTHING.ps1 again.

### Issue: Candidates not loading

**Copy the data file:**
```powershell
Copy-Item -Path "E:\HamletUnified\full_consolidation\candidates\master\CLEANED_CANDIDATES_20251015_120734.csv" -Destination "public\candidates.csv" -Force
```

## 💡 Important Decisions I Made

### Why No Automated Social Media Scraping?

You asked about automated social media collection. **I didn't implement this because:**

1. ❌ **Facebook/Instagram automation = Account ban** (Terms of Service violation)
2. ❌ **Twitter API = $100+/month** for write access
3. ❌ **Scraping at scale = IP blocks** and legal issues
4. ❌ **Auto-posting = Spam laws** (could be criminal in some countries)

### What You Should Do Instead

✅ **Manual discovery** - Google search for each candidate (10-30 sec each)  
✅ **Browser bookmarks** - Save profiles as you find them  
✅ **Spreadsheet tracking** - Log all social media links  
✅ **Ethical outreach** - Personal emails to public addresses  

**This is legal, ethical, and actually works better for building trust.**
