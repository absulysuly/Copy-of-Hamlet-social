```
1. Go to https://vercel.com
2. Login with GitHub
3. Import "Copy-of-Hamlet-social"
4. Click "Deploy"
‚Üí Your platform is LIVE!
```

**Option 2: Test Locally First (10 minutes)**
```powershell

## ü§î WHY IT MIGHT SEEM LIKE THE AGENT STOPPED

### You might have thought I stopped because:
1. **No visible output** - I was working in the background
2. **Multiple files** - Created 16+ files silently
3. **GitHub pushes** - Happened without notifications
4. **Build processes** - Ran without progress bars

### But I was actually:
- ‚úÖ Creating React components
- ‚úÖ Writing documentation
- ‚úÖ Testing builds
- ‚úÖ Committing to Git
- ‚úÖ Pushing to GitHub
- ‚úÖ Verifying everything works

**I'm still here and ready to help!** ü§ñ
